.SYNOPSIS
    Clean up test-generated folders

.DESCRIPTION
    This script removes all the test-generated output and test folders that were
    created by the performance tests. These folders were created because the Config
    class automatically creates directories when instantiated.

.PARAMETER DryRun
    Show what would be deleted without actually deleting

.PARAMETER Force
    Skip confirmation prompt

.EXAMPLE
    .\cleanup_test_folders.ps1
    Remove test folders with confirmation

.EXAMPLE
    .\cleanup_test_folders.ps1 -DryRun
    Show what would be deleted

.EXAMPLE
    .\cleanup_test_folders.ps1 -Force
    Remove folders without confirmation
